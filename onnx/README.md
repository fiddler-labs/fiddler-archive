# ONNX example 

In this example a sklearn model is trained, then it is converted
to ONNX and saved to file rf_iris.onnx. pacakge.py loads ONNX model
from this file and calls predict on it.

To build, run and test this example:

```
  make all 
```

Check out makefile for more details about specific targets
